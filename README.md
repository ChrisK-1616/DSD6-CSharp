# MonoGame Tutorial Example Game

This is a port of the work done on the "Deep Space D6" board game conversion which was initially implemented in Python using the Pyglet multi-media library. Included in this example code is the Finite State Machine (FSM) library which is separated from the main game implementation to make it portable.
